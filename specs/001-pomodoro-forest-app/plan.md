# Implementation Plan: Forest-style Pomodoro App

**Branch**: `001-pomodoro-forest-app` | **Date**: 2025-10-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-pomodoro-forest-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a Forest-style Pomodoro application for iOS. The app will help users focus by growing a virtual tree during a 25-minute session. The core technologies used will be SwiftUI for the UI, SwiftData for local persistence, and Combine for managing the timer.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Swift 5.9
**Primary Dependencies**: None (No third-party dependencies)
**Storage**: SwiftData
**Testing**: XCTest / XCUITest
**Target Platform**: iOS 17+
**Project Type**: Mobile
**Performance Goals**: 60fps animations, <50MB memory usage during active sessions
**Constraints**: Must be a native iOS application.
**Scale/Scope**: The app will store all user data locally. The forest view will be a single scrollable grid.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Simplicity and Offline-First**: Does the feature maintain the app's simplicity and offline-first capabilities? - **PASS**
- **Test-First Development**: Has the feature been developed using TDD? - **PASS** (Will be enforced during implementation)
- **Performance**: Does the feature meet the 60fps animation and <2s cold start requirements? - **PASS** (Will be verified during testing)
- **Accessibility**: Does the feature fully support VoiceOver and Dynamic Type? - **PASS** (Will be implemented and tested)

**Structure Decision**: A standard SwiftUI project structure will be used, separating Models, Views, and ViewModels. Services will be used to encapsulate persistence and notification logic.
