# Feature Specification: Forest-style Pomodoro App

**Feature Branch**: `001-pomodoro-forest-app`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a Forest-style Pomodoro app for iOS: start a 25-minute session to "plant" a tree that grows through 5 stages; cancel/quit kills the tree; completion saves it to a personal forest. Show countdown, pause/resume, local notification, and background-accurate timing. Store completed/abandoned sessions locally; show a forest grid and stats (total trees, total focus time, today's count, daily streak). Out of scope: custom durations, species, sync, sharing, watch, widgets."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Start a Focus Session (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to start a 25-minute focus session to plant a virtual tree, so that I can stay focused on a task.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the app.

**Independent Test**: A user can start a session, see the countdown timer, and a tree should start growing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the app is open, **When** I tap the "Start Session" button, **Then** a 25-minute countdown timer starts.
2.  **Given** a session is active, **When** the timer is running, **Then** a tree visually grows through 5 stages over the 25-minute period.
3.  **Given** a session is active, **When** I leave the app, **Then** I receive a local notification when the session is complete.
4.  **Given** a session is active, **When** I background the app, **Then** the timer continues to count down accurately.

### User Story 2 - Complete a Focus Session (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to complete a focus session, so that my tree is saved to my forest and my stats are updated.

**Why this priority**: This provides the reward and tracking for the user.

**Independent Test**: A user can complete a session, and the tree is added to their forest view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a session is complete, **When** the timer reaches zero, **Then** the tree is added to my personal forest grid.
2.  **Given** a session is complete, **When** the timer reaches zero, **Then** my stats (total trees, total focus time, today's count, daily streak) are updated.

### User Story 3 - Cancel a Focus Session (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to be able to cancel or quit a focus session, so that I can stop a session if I get interrupted.

**Why this priority**: Provides user control over the session.

**Independent Test**: A user can cancel a session, and the tree is marked as "killed".

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a session is active, **When** I tap the "Cancel" or "Quit" button, **Then** the session ends and the tree is marked as withered or dead.
2.  **Given** a session is cancelled, **When** I view my forest, **Then** the withered tree is visible.

### User Story 4 - View Forest and Stats (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to view my forest and stats, so that I can see my progress and stay motivated.

**Why this priority**: This provides the long-term motivation for the user.

**Independent Test**: A user can navigate to a "Forest" or "Stats" screen and see their completed trees and statistics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I have completed sessions, **When** I view my forest, **Then** I see a grid of all my successfully grown trees.
2.  **Given** I have completed sessions, **When** I view my stats, **Then** I see my total number of trees, total focus time, today's tree count, and current daily streak.

### Edge Cases

-   What happens if the app is terminated by the OS during a session?
-   How does the app handle date changes for the daily streak?
-   What happens if the device runs out of storage?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to start a 25-minute focus session.
-   **FR-002**: The system MUST display a countdown timer for the active session.
-   **FR-003**: The system MUST visually represent a growing tree in 5 stages during a session.
-   **FR-004**: The system MUST allow users to pause and resume a session.
-   **FR-005**: The system MUST send a local notification upon session completion.
-   **FR-006**: The system MUST maintain accurate timer countdown even when the app is in the background.
-   **FR-007**: The system MUST save completed sessions and associate them with a grown tree.
-   **FR-008**: The system MUST save abandoned sessions and associate them with a "killed" tree.
-   **FR-009**: The system MUST display a grid of all grown trees (the "forest") in a single, scrollable view.
-   **FR-010**: The system MUST display user stats: total trees, total focus time, today's count, and daily streak.
-   **FR-011**: All session data MUST be stored locally on the device.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

-   **Session**: Represents a single focus session. Attributes: `startTime`, `endTime`, `duration`, `status` (completed, abandoned), `tree`.
-   **Tree**: Represents the virtual tree planted during a session. Attributes: `growthStage` (1-5), `isWithered`.
-   **UserStats**: Represents the user's statistics. Attributes: `totalTrees`, `totalFocusTime`, `dailyStreak`, `lastSessionDate`.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: 95% of users can successfully start and complete a focus session without errors.
-   **SC-002**: The app must maintain a 60fps frame rate during all animations.
-   **SC-003**: The app's cold start time must be less than 2 seconds.
-   **SC-004**: The app must fully support VoiceOver and Dynamic Type for all user-facing elements.
-   **SC-005**: The timer must be accurate to within 1 second over a 25-minute session, even with backgrounding.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-16

- Q: How should the app display the forest when it contains a large number of trees? â†’ A: Display all trees in a single, scrollable grid, regardless of the number.

## Assumptions

-   The app is intended for iOS only.
-   The user has granted permissions for local notifications.
-   The device has sufficient storage for local data.
