# Forest Focus Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
Code must be clean, maintainable, and well-documented. All code should adhere to established coding standards and best practices.

### II. Testing Standards
Comprehensive testing is mandatory. This includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability and correctness. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is strongly encouraged.

### III. User Experience Consistency
A consistent and intuitive user experience is paramount. All user-facing components and interactions must adhere to the project's design system and UX guidelines.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application must meet defined performance benchmarks. Code should be optimized for speed and efficiency to ensure a responsive user experience.

## Development Workflow

All code changes must be submitted through a pull request and receive at least one approval from another team member before being merged.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for project standards. Any amendments must be proposed and agreed upon by the team, with a clear migration plan for existing code if necessary.
